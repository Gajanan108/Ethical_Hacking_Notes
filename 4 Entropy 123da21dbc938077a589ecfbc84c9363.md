# 4. Entropy

In this scenario, we need to covertly access an employee's mobile device on the `192.168.0.0/24` subnet, locate malicious ELF files stored in a folder named "getme," perform a deep scan on these files, and obtain the last four digits of the SHA-384 hash of the file with the highest entropy value. Hereâ€™s how to approach this step by step:

### Step 1: Access the Mobile Device

1. **Identify the Device**: Use a network scanning tool like `nmap` to identify the mobile device on the subnet. Run the following command:
    
    ```powershell
    nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
    
    ```
    
    Look for the device that corresponds to the employee's mobile device.
    
2. **Establish a Connection**: If the device is accessible via SSH or another remote access protocol, connect to it. For example, if SSH is enabled:
    
    ```powershell
    ssh user@<IP_ADDRESS>
    
    ```
    
    Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the actual IP address of the mobile device.
    

### Step 2: Locate the ELF Files

1. **Navigate to the Directory**: Once connected, navigate to the "getme" folder where the ELF files are stored:
    
    ```
    cd /path/to/getme
    
    ```
    
2. **List the ELF Files**: Use the `ls` command to list the files in the directory and identify the ELF files:
    
    ```
    ls -l *.elf
    
    ```
    

### Step 3: Perform a Deep Scan on ELF Files

1. **Install Entropy Analysis Tool**: If not already installed, you may need to install a tool like `ent` to analyze the entropy of the ELF files. You can typically install it using a package manager:
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get install ent
    
    ```
    
2. **Analyze Entropy**: Run the entropy analysis on the ELF files in the "getme" folder:
    
    ```
    ent *.elf
    
    ```
    
    This command will output the entropy values for each ELF file.
    
3. **Identify the File with Highest Entropy**: Review the output to find the ELF file with the highest entropy value. Note the filename for the next step.

### Step 4: Calculate the SHA-384 Hash

1. **Calculate the SHA-384 Hash**: Use the `sha384sum` command to calculate the hash of the ELF file with the highest entropy. Replace `<highest_entropy_file.elf>` with the actual filename:
    
    ```
    sha384sum <highest_entropy_file.elf>
    
    ```
    
    This command will output the SHA-384 hash of the file.
    
2. **Extract the Last Four Digits**: From the output of the `sha384sum` command, take the last four digits of the hash. For example, if the output is:
    
    ```
    3a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0e1f2g3h4i5j6k7l8m9n0o1p2q3r4s5t6u7v8w9x0y1z2a3b4c5d6e7f8g9h0i1j2k3l4m5n6o7p8q9r0
    
    ```
    
    The last four digits would be `0f2g`.
    

### Summary

By following these steps, you can covertly access the employee's mobile device, locate the malicious ELF files, perform a deep scan to find the file with the highest entropy, and obtain the last four digits of its SHA-384 hash. Always ensure that such actions are conducted ethically and with proper authorization.
