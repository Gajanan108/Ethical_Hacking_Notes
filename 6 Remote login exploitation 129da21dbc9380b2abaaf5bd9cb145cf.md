# 6. Remote login exploitation

Ethical Hacking Learning Task: Exploit Remote Login and Command Execution on Linux Target
In this scenario, you're tasked with exploiting a remote login and gaining command-line execution on a Linux target in a subnet to access a sensitive file named finalsecret.txt. I'll outline the steps assuming all necessary permissions have been granted for this ethical hacking exercise.

1. Assumed Information:
Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24
Target IP: One of the hosts in the subnet, assumed to be 192.168.1.50 (you'll scan to find the exact IP).
Vulnerability: SSH (port 22) is open, and there’s a known vulnerability in the SSH service running on the Linux target (assume weak credentials or outdated SSH version).
Tooling: You will use tools like Nmap, Hydra, Metasploit, and scp to exploit and retrieve the sensitive file.
Objective: Access the file finalsecret.txt located in /home/user/secret/ on the target machine, download it, and read its content.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Identify the Target in the Subnet
First, identify live hosts in the subnet using nmap:
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
This command will give a list of live hosts. Look for the target machine (192.168.1.50 in this case).

Step 2: Scan for Open Ports on the Target
Next, scan the identified target (192.168.1.50) for open ports:
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.50
If port 22 (SSH) is open, this indicates that the target is running an SSH service.

Step 3: Brute-force SSH Login (If Vulnerable)
You can use Hydra to brute-force SSH login using a wordlist:
hydra -l username -P /path/to/passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.50
Replace username with a guessed or known username and point Hydra to a wordlist (passwords.txt).
Once Hydra cracks the password, note down the credentials.

Step 4: Gain SSH Access to the Target
After retrieving the credentials, log in to the target using SSH:
ssh username@192.168.1.50
Once inside, navigate to the directory where the finalsecret.txt file is located:
cd /home/user/secret/ls
If the file finalsecret.txt exists, you’ve located the target file.

Step 5: Download the Sensitive File to Your Local Machine
Use scp (secure copy) to download the file from the remote machine to your local machine:
scp username@192.168.1.50:/home/user/secret/finalsecret.txt /local/path/
Replace /local/path/ with the path on your local machine where you want to save the file.

Step 6: Read the Contents of the File
Once the file is on your local machine, use any text editor or cat command to read the content:
cat /local/path/finalsecret.txt
The content of finalsecret.txt will be the answer to your question.

Summary:
Nmap was used to find live hosts and open SSH port.
Hydra was used to brute-force SSH login credentials.
SSH was exploited to gain command-line access.
The sensitive file finalsecret.txt was copied from the target to the local machine using scp.
The file was read locally to retrieve the answer.

This step-by-step guide outlines a basic approach to exploiting SSH and obtaining sensitive data from a Linux target. Ethical hackers should always ensure they have explicit permission before performing such actions.
